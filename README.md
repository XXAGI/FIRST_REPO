# My First Web Project

This is a simple web project created to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the web page.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You should see a heading, a paragraph, and a button.
3. Click the button to see an alert message.

## Learning Goals
